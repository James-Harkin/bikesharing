# Overview:
A proposed bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa leaves investors wanting more information. This analysis takes data from New York City's bike sharing program and is meant to solidify the proposal.
# Results:
## The visulisations:
* Checkout Times by Minutes shows that most bikes are only used for 10 minutes. With people making short trips wear and tear would be minimal.
* Trips by Weekday shows that the bikesharing program is consistany busy on certain days and times. Consistancy makes preparation and maintenence easier.
* Gender Breakdown shows that the riders are about 27% female and 73% male. Both of the above visualisations are also broken down by gender.
* Top Staring Locations and Top Ending locations. These two maps look very similar, which is a good sign. The bikes being moved evenly prevents high maintenence.
# Summary:
New York City's bike sharing program is succesful. Des Moines is a much different city than New York however. This analysis prooves that bike sharing programs can work in cities with high demand. Des Moines' demand for transportation may determine the success.
I propose that more analysis be done on alternative modes of transportaion in Des Moines. How often are they being used, and how much are people paying?
Owning a bike in New York City can be more difficult than in Des Moines. Des Moines residents having a high volume of bike owners could effect the programs success too. More research should be done on that.
